## Key Files Modified/Created

### Backend Changes:
- `server/storage.ts` - Added `deleteUnit()` method
- `server/routes.ts` - Added `DELETE /api/units/:id` route

### Frontend Components:
- `client/src/components/dialogs/view-unit-dialog.tsx` - New comprehensive view
- `client/src/components/dialogs/delete-unit-dialog.tsx` - New deletion confirmation
- `client/src/components/forms/inventory-form.tsx` - Enhanced for edit mode
- `client/src/pages/inventory.tsx` - Updated with all CRUD operations

## User Workflow

1. **View Units**: Click "View" button to see comprehensive unit details
2. **Edit Units**: Click "Edit" button or "Edit Unit" from view dialog
3. **Delete Units**: Click delete icon (trash) or "Delete Unit" from view dialog
4. **Add Units**: Click "Add Unit" button (existing functionality enhanced)

## Safety Features

- Delete confirmation with unit details preview
- Only available units can be deleted (sold/booked units protected)
- Loading states during operations
- Toast notifications for success/error feedback
- Proper error handling throughout

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/units` - List units
- `GET /api/units/:id` - Get single unit
- `POST /api/units` - Create unit
- `PUT /api/units/:id` - Update unit
- `DELETE /api/units/:id` - Delete unit (NEW)

All changes are minimal and build upon the existing solid foundation without breaking any existing functionality.
